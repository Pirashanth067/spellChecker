# spellChecker
The main problem of the basic spell checker is about the spell detection algorithm of the project. It is planned in the presumption that all word errors are the words that are NOT in the dictionary. These are delegated non word spelling error. Be that as it may, there are situations where spelling mistake isn't just a "spelling mistakes", think about the following scenario: I would like a pieece of cake as disert . By simply looking at the words in the sentence above, you can tell the mistakes. However, errors still occur as the word “pieece” and “disert” are not suitable to the context. They are called real world spelling errors. In a spell checker that uses dictionary check, this kind of error will have to be checked in the first place.
